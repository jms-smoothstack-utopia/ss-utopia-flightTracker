## Valid Longitude and Latitude
From [this post on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/47188298/12676661):
> Valid longitudes are from -180 to 180 degrees.
> Latitudes are supposed to be from -90 degrees to 90 degrees, but areas very near to the poles are not indexable.
> So exact limits, as specified by EPSG:900913 / EPSG:3785 / OSGEO:41001 are the following:
>  -  Valid longitudes are from -180 to 180 degrees.
>  -  Valid latitudes are from -85.05112878 to 85.05112878 degrees.
